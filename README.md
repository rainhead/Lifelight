# Lifelight

The current objectives of this project are:
- to continue learn to use SwiftUI effectively
- to have offline access to iNaturalist observations, starting with my own

Over time, I would like to develop this application into a place to actively learn about the organisms in my environment by collecting and organizing:
- my own and others' observations
- scientific information about species, including descriptions, observation maps, and phenology
- species checklists

I am not committed to using (only) Swift in the long term, but I'm starting by building something I would actually use.

Feel free to get in touch if this project is interesting to you.
